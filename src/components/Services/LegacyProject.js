        "The satisfaction from seeing a completed artifact the person knows will
        speak of them and for them in the years to come is tremendously
        gratifying. It is the ripple of their life continuing to shape and form
        the future. It is a gift to those they love." Henry Fersko-Weiss "Caring
        for the Dying The Doula Approach to a Meaningful Death"
